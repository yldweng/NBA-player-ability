## Inferring NBA players ability using latent variable model

a tuneable data-analytic pipeline (written in R) for the transition from raw competition and performance data to player and team abilities.

Applied the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) technique and implemented a computationally efficient algorithm for updating the abilities.

Data: Game statistics from Basketball Reference website (https://www.basketball-reference.com/).

Player efficiency rating: https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019_advanced.html

(Use data for the season 2018-19 as an example)
