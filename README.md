a tuneable data-analytic pipeline (written in R) for the transition from raw competition and performance data to player and team abilities.

Applied the stochastic gradient descent technique and implemented a computationally efficient algorithm for updating the abilities.

Data: Game statistics from Basketball Reference website.
